Run each of the agents above (6 in total) for 1000 time-steps (this is one run) for each instance of the environment. At each time step record the received reward. For a given agent, at each time step, average out the rewards over 50 instances of the environment. Draw a plot (e.g., using Matplotlib) of average rewards received vs. time step. Do this for all agents and plot it in the same plot. Now you can compare different agents (i.e., different strategies). Since different agents have different hyper-parameters, play with different settings and you can generate multiple different plots so as to aid comparison. Analyze the plots, write about your key observations, e.g., what strategy works\n",
